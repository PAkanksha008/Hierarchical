# Hierarchical :
Project title: Analysis and prediction of small custerms.csv file of mall market called as phonix small, find out on the basis of clients requriments of dendogram using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy", to ace the No of linkage of clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement :
The american market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest no of growth in there business market
As a DataScience engineer find out which hierarcy cluster give maximum linkage in upcomming future.

# conclusion:
Accoriding to the model building as a enginner my prediction cluster no 3 hightest no of linkage.
# Insights :
1.cluster 1 contains "red" which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum euclinding distance from the centriod upto annual income approixmate 139ks
2.cluster 2 contains "blue" which shows that unsupervized learning cluster as max eucliding distance from centriod upto 79 to 80ks
3.cluster 3 contains "green" which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum euclinding distance from centriod upto 139 ks
4.cluster 4 contains "light blue" which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum euclinding distance from centriod upto 39 to 40 ks
5.cluster 5 contains "pink" which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum euclinding distance from centriod upto 42 to 41 ks
